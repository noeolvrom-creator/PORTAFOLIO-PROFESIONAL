# PID Tuning Application – Qt / C++

## Overview
Desktop application developed to assist in the tuning of PID controllers
using frequency response analysis.

## Software Stack
- C++
- Qt Framework
- Serial communication with Arduino

## Key Features
- Visualization of Bode and Nyquist diagrams
- Analysis of transfer functions
- Interactive adjustment of PID parameters
- Real-time communication with embedded hardware

## System Integration
- Serial communication with Arduino for uploading PID gains
- Real-time testing and validation of controller performance

## Testing & Validation
- Frequency response testing on different dynamic systems
- Validation of tuning results on position and speed control systems
- Achieved tuning accuracy with errors below 3%

## Notes
This project focused on control theory, embedded communication,
and graphical interface development.
